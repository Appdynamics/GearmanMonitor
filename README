###Note
Please make sure to not use tab (\t) while editing yaml files. You may want to validate the yaml file using a yaml validator http://yamllint.com/

1. Configure the gearman server instances by editing the config.yaml file in `<MACHINE_AGENT_HOME>/monitors/GearmanMonitor/`. Below is the format

  ```
  servers:
    - hostName: "192.168.56.5"
      port: 4730
      userName: ""
      password: ""

metricPrefix: "Custom Metrics|Gearman|"


2. Configure the path to the config.yaml file by editing the <task-arguments> in the monitor.xml file. Below is the sample

     ```
     <task-arguments>
         <!-- config file-->
                    <argument name="config-file" is-required="true" default-value="monitors/GearmanMonitor/config.yml" />
